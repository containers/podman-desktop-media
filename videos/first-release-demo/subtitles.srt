1
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:2,500
RHEL VMs extension for Podman Desktop
(demo on MacOS)

2
00:00:3,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The RHEL VMs extension needs the
Red Hat Authentication extension to be installed

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need to connect to your
Red Hat account to download RHEL images

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now install the RHEL VMs extension

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The extension installs a macadam
executable on your system

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:8,000
Let's create our first RHEL VM...

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The image is downloaded from the Red Hat portal

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and the VM is created from this image

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To help troubleshooting, you can see
the machine with the macadam executable

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We can now start the VM...

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and access it from an integrated terminal

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Enjoy running RHEL on your machine!
